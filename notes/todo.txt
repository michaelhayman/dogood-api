================
Do Good API todo
================

Notes/Ideas:
============
- Do your best to write tests for every model, controller, route
- Perfect goods & users first
- Remove all unused code and parts for clarity once API is complete again
- Try to get 100% passing tests as a habit
- Check in everything ready to go now
- decouple: don't use after_create.
- Implement teardown method to get rid of instance variables in tests?

# add_column :goods, :followers, :integer, :default => 0
# increment_counter :goods, :followers
# decrement_counter :goods, :followers

config/environments/development.rb
- config.reload_classes_only_on_change = false

- Think about whether messages key should be in a separate object and mapping

- COMMIT & clear out unused stuff. REMOVE stuff from view so it's done.

- Test test test and commit before adding features

    # Fog.mock!
    # Fog.credentials_path = Rails.root.join('config/fog_credentials.yml')
    # connection = Fog::Storage.new(:provider => 'AWS')
    # connection.directories.create(:key => 'my_bucket')


To do:
======

- Fix votes, follows, reports

- I want votes to be likes
- All of the DGVote modelling seems unnecessary now, eliminate to
  simplify codebase

- look into why follows aren't being cached (user decorator uses em)

- render_errors?  errors not appearing properly in iOS app in some
  places

- Prevent reporting your own post

- Tap settings - it loads settings page with spinner then loads
  your current user settings.  if it fails it pops back.

- Make a non-rails ember app to take care of resetting password

- Push controller tests to 95%+ coverage

- Rename goods to posts...

- Move rewards#claim logic to model

- Remove all comments from files like environment.rb, uploaders, etc.
  Be pro.  !git grep "\# "

- Implement site settings

- Need to collapse avatar to url & test

- Move after_create good.add_points to lib
  - or use observers?
  - after voting too

- Change voteable to votable to fit with plugin

Done:
=====

2014/3/9
- Fixed remove vote and figured out CRUD
- Fix render_ok method

2014/3/8
- User serializer work, followings, etc.
- Test new user decorator methods

2014/3/7
- Working on follows
- Move methods out of user serializer and into decorator and test

2014/3/6
- Test passwords controller
  - Fix user message key
    - Only include it when requested
- Test uploaders - not necessary
- follows_controller tests
- Somehow fucked up again? stash and try tests then narrow it down
- 237 tests passing.
- Fixing tests.
- 6 failures 9 errors down to 5 failures.
- Drop error handling from goods and other places as it's moved to
  application rescue_froms

2014/3/5
- 57 tests failing.
- Delete all to_builder methods
- Need to figure out callbacks
  - load error file at initialization, delete all other references thereafter
- Need to figure out why I can't reference serializers by name unless they're
  in the model files
  - Fixed AMS include problem: have to name the file same as class
- Fixed many tests
- Comment & tag serializers
- Simplify error handling

2014/3/4
- Made a nice helper for pagination
- Fixed many tests
- There's something odd about my development environment causing problems
  - every time i write to goods_controller it crashes the site.
  - but under 'test' it doesn't do that.
  - maybe it has to do with caching?
- Annoyed now because comment is being nested all of a sudden
  - but more annoyed that i dont have version history to bisect it
  - work more granularly
  - start checking in known good changes now
  - figured out that it's because i took out the decorator comment


  so is strangers with candy
  - forget it for now it's distracting you
  - Comments are gross on iOS

2014/3/3
- Psyched about AMS. Goods should be:
  - tested
  - finalized JSON output
    - paginated
    - full nested nested objects
  - jbuilder files removed
- Make todo default on iOS (involves changing welcome, etc...)
- Getting frustrated at not being able to nest decorator objects
- Convert all serialization code into decorators & drop them
    - Restrict API to return less info about users (good.comments.users too deep
      for jbuilder)
      - to solve this use listing#show example
        - decorate collection & convert to_builder
- Test nested nested objects: i.e. entities.  then I should be clear to
  continue using jbuilder.
- Callback helper issue not fixed

2014/3/2
- Update route to show action on iOS to supply param id instead of good_id
- Circular CallbackHelper bug
  - solved by
Controller tests
  - reports_controller_test.rb
  - passwords_controller_test.rb
  - votes_controller_test.rb
  - registrations_controller_test.rb
- fix validate_name
- sessions_controller_test.rb
- Find tips on moving controller code to model, raise bubbling
- add 'unprocessable' test

2014/3/1
- tags & tag controller

2014/2/28
- Test drove out tags controller popular, which wasn't working
  as expected
- Added rewards controller tests
- Test tags controller
  - popular doesn't seem to work at all - rework it

2014/2/27
- Make show action work
- Check iOS error messages (auth popup not working)
- Make error json pop up dialog on iOS
- Entities aren't working no they are

2014/2/26
- Update iOS keyPaths
- Add rest of keys to good output
- Boot up iOS app!
- Add basic HTTP auth to iOS app
- Do same with likes & re-goods & test
- Convert model specs to tests

- Continue testing at each step
- Replace good meta_stream with decoration
- Got basic auth working
- Get good_commented etc working
  - Get decorator to work!

2014/1/25
- Decide on kaminari or will_paginate

2014/1/24
- Lazy load user's comment_ids, shared_ids, liked_ids only once per request
- All tests passing except add_points!
- Hammer away on making the create action of good controller
- Figure out why constants aren't being included

2014/1/23
- Sick

2014/1/22
- Port zapi constants, rescue blocks to goods controller
- Make create action pass for authenticated user
- Use new guest user types

2014/1/21
- Create a guest user type
- Load user's comment_ids, saved_ids, liked_ids once per request if requested
- Write current user tests
- Wrote routes tests
- Wrote more good tests
- Split notes files apart
- Watched guard files

2014/1/20
- Sign up for github & upload private repos
- Basic test user model
- Add two tests to good
- Figure out why user factory is not working as expected
